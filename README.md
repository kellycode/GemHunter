Doesn't Scale Properly in WebGL

These are the steps

Loaded the project directly into Unity from the asset store page.

Changed player screen size to 1920 x 1080

Changed project build profile to WebGL

Build and Run

This is the result in WebGL (Same result with config.matchWebGLToCanvasSize true or false)

Same result in Chrome, Edge and Opera browsers

In the Unity Editor it also doesn't scale properly running in the Game Tab and this is also what it looks like as a Windows 11 exe build
